* username: riemann
* password: password

ðŸŽ‰How it works:
1. Bind to LDAP using the manager user id and password specified in the ContextSource.
2. Perform a lookup on the user id (entered from the login screen) using the userSearch bean.
3. Get the fully distinguished name of the user that matches.
4. Use that user and the password (entered) to bind to LDAP again.
5. Search for all of the groups the user is in based on the groupSearchFilter configuration.
